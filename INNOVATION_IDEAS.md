## 🌟 THE GOLDEN CONCEPT

**"Engineering Portfolio as a Living System"**

Think of your portfolio itself as an engineered system:
- Satellites = your projects orbiting a central mission
- Earth = your core skills/values
- Ground stations = contact points
- Atmospheric layers = education/experience
- System status = real GitHub/activity data
- Everything is interconnected and animated

This metaphor extends through the entire site:
- "Launch a new project" (satellite deployment)
- "Skill orbit decay" (updating old tech)
- "Systems alignment" (related projects)
- "Orbital insertion" (project integration)

**End of brainstorm. Most impressive: Satellite Tracker + GitHub Integration + Physics Cards = Legendary portfolio** 🚀
